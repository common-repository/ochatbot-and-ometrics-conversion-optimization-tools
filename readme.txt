== HOW DOES OCHATBOT WORK? ==

Ochatbot's AI uses Ometrics' proprietary Scripted NLP AI and Generative AI to create natural-sounding answers to user questions. The AI first engages the customers with questions to determine the best way to respond.  This can often be broken down into these use cases:

User wants…

* to look for an exact product
* to look for a product for a particular use 
* to ask additional questions to determine the best product fit
* to look for customer support or service
* to look for order status and tracking. 
* to inquire about something that needs legally accurate responses, such as FDA-approved products, medical questions, warranties, etc.
* to switch to live chat. If a support person is not available, Ochatbot sends in a ticket.
* receive a quote and go through qualifying questions. Ochatbot then sends the lead as an email or to the ticketing system.

After the Engagement question is defined, the AI will either respond with a scripted or generative response. The generative response is only from the data gathered from the site and the documents provided.

Each week a report is sent to you with the top KPIs such as:

* Page Engagement: See what pages receive the most chatbot inquiries, so you can improve page conversion rate. 
* Top Button Clicks: Gain additional insights about customer interests by tracking their button clicks within Ochatbot.  
* Total number of sales generated by Ochatbot, number of support tickets, and more.
